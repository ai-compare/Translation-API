# Translation-API
This repositery provides code to implement [AI-Compare Translation API](https://www.ai-compare.com/text_apis/automatic_translation/). [AI-Compare Translation API](https://www.ai-compare.com/text_apis/automatic_translation/) allows to call Translation APIs from Google Cloud Platform Translate, AWS Translate, Microsoft Azure Cognitives Service Language, and IBM Watson Natural Language Translation. It permits to get results from these providers and compare the results.

[AI-Compare](https://www.ai-compare.com/) is a SaaS providing APIs connected to big (AWS, GCP, etc.) and small AI providers: [object detection](https://www.ai-compare.com/vision_apis/object_detection), [OCR](https://www.ai-compare.com/vision_apis/ocr), [NLP](https://www.ai-compare.com/text_apis/sentiment_analysis/), [speech-to-text](https://www.ai-compare.com/audio_apis/speech_recognition), custom vision, etc. Our solution allows users to compare the performance of these providers APIs according to their data and use them directly via our API thus offering great flexibility and making it very easy to change supplier. In particular, we offer better performance with the "Genius" feature that cleverly combines results from multiple providers.
